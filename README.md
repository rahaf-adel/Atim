# Project Name: Atim

## Idea:
A system to help university graduate students find work, help universities improve education outcomes and help companies find Saudi workers.

## Inspiration:
The inspiration came from a reality in which most recent graduates live, where they find it difficult to find a suitable job due to the lack of experience and qualifications to get a job.

## Goals:
- Facilitate the process of finding a job for graduate students and reduce financial and age waste.
- Improving university education curricula and outcomes, and determining the majors available for admission for the next year, according to unemployment rates.
- Increasing the percentage of Saudization in companies, and facilitating the finding of Saudi graduate students with the appropriate specializations for training and employment.
